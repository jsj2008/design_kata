How I do it?

every few days, before lunch at work, me and my teammates are going though one of Gang of Four design pattern (just 15 minutes), later on, i'm coding it in c++ for practice.

code is compiling cleanly under g++ and clang++ with -Wall -pedantic.
tested on MacOs 10.6, no animals were harmed; one cat was harassing me.

Rules
-----
one pattern, one file, no hassle.
